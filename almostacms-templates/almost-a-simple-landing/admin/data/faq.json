    {
      "id": "really-free",
      "question": "Is it really free?",
      "answer": "Yes! AlmostaCMS is completely free and open source (MIT License). We use GitHub Pages for hosting, which is free for public repositories. There are no hidden costs, no credit card required. The project is supported by optional donations and feature funding from the community."
    },
    {
      "id": "need-coding",
      "question": "Do I need to know how to code?",
      "answer": "No! AlmostaCMS has a visual editor for all content. You edit your website through beautiful forms, just like any other CMS. The only time you'd touch code is if you want to customize the design (which is optional)."
    },
    {
      "id": "custom-domain",
      "question": "Can I use my own domain name?",
      "answer": "Yes! GitHub Pages supports custom domains. You can connect your own domain (e.g., www.yourname.com) to your AlmostaCMS site. We're working on a setup wizard to make this even easier (check the feature funding section to support it!)."
    },
    {
      "id": "switch-platforms",
      "question": "What if I want to switch to another platform?",
      "answer": "No lock-in! Your website lives in your own GitHub repository. You can download all your content anytime, or connect it to any other platform. You truly own your data."
    },
    {
      "id": "update-content",
      "question": "How do I update my content?",
      "answer": "Just visit yoursite.com/admin, login with GitHub, and edit your content through our visual forms. Changes are saved to your GitHub repository and your site rebuilds automatically in about 30 seconds."
    },
    {
      "id": "data-secure",
      "question": "Is my data secure?",
      "answer": "Very secure! Your content is stored in your GitHub repository with enterprise-grade security. We use GitHub OAuth for authentication - we never see your password. You control all the permissions."
    },
    {
      "id": "feature-funding",
      "question": "How does feature funding work?",
      "answer": "You can contribute to specific features you want built. When a feature reaches its funding goal, I prioritize building it. You can see progress updates and the feature gets released to everyone (it's open source!). Think of it as Kickstarter for features."
    },
    {
      "id": "github-required",
      "question": "Do I need a GitHub account?",
      "answer": "Yes, you need a free GitHub account. Don't have one? It takes 30 seconds to create at github.com. GitHub is used by over 100 million developers worldwide and is completely free for personal use."
    },
    {
      "id": "support",
      "question": "What kind of support do you offer?",
      "answer": "Community support is available through our GitHub Discussions and comprehensive documentation. We also have video tutorials and a knowledge base. Feature funders get updates on their requested features."
    },
    {
      "id": "open-source",
      "question": "Is AlmostaCMS really open source?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! MIT License. You can view all the code, contribute improvements, fork it for your own use, or even use it commercially. The entire project is transparent and community-driven."
